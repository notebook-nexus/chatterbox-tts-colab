   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/notebook-nexus/chatterbox-tts-colab.git
   cd chatterbox-tts-colab
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab**
   - Upload the notebook to your Google Drive
   - Open with Google Colab
   - Test that all cells run successfully

3. **Create a Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Bug Fixes**: Resolve issues with notebook execution, audio processing, or error handling
- **Feature Enhancements**: Add new TTS models, improve voice cloning quality, or expand language support
- **Documentation**: Improve README, add tutorials, or create usage examples
- **Performance Optimizations**: Reduce processing time or memory usage
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance user interface elements within the notebook
- **Testing**: Add validation scripts or test cases

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Check Existing Issues**
   - Browse open issues to see if your contribution is already being discussed
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`

2. **Create or Comment on an Issue**
   - For bug fixes: Describe the problem and your proposed solution
   - For new features: Explain the use case and implementation approach
   - Get feedback from maintainers before starting significant work

3. **Develop Your Changes**
   - Follow the coding standards outlined below
   - Test your changes thoroughly in Google Colab
   - Ensure backward compatibility when possible

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference related issues using `#issue-number`
   - Provide detailed description of changes made
   - Include testing instructions

## Development Guidelines

### Notebook Structure

- **Setup Cells**: Environment initialization, library installations
- **Configuration**: Model settings, parameters, file paths
- **Core Functions**: TTS processing, voice cloning logic
- **User Interface**: Input widgets, progress indicators
- **Output Handling**: Audio generation, file saving, visualization

### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 conventions
- **Cell Organization**: Keep cells focused on single responsibilities
- **Comments**: Add clear explanations for complex operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error catching and user feedback
- **Memory Management**: Clean up large objects when possible

### Notebook Best Practices

```python
# Good: Clear cell purpose and error handling
try:
    # Install required packages
    !pip install -q chatterbox-tts
    print("✅ Dependencies installed successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Installation failed: {e}")
    raise

# Good: User-friendly configuration
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

text_input = widgets.Textarea(
    value='Enter your text here...',
    placeholder='Type your message',
    description='Text:',
    layout=widgets.Layout(width='100%', height='100px')
)
display(text_input)
```

### Audio Processing Guidelines

- Support common audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC)
- Validate audio quality before processing
- Provide clear feedback on processing status
- Handle edge cases (very short/long audio, noisy samples)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting changes, verify:

- [ ] All notebook cells execute without errors
- [ ] Audio generation works with sample text
- [ ] Voice cloning produces recognizable results
- [ ] File uploads and downloads function correctly
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] UI elements respond appropriately

### Test Cases to Consider

1. **Input Validation**
   - Empty text input
   - Very long text (>1000 characters)
   - Special characters and multilingual text
   - Invalid audio files

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Different audio formats and quality levels
   - Various voice characteristics (male/female, accents)
   - Background noise in reference audio

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Insufficient GPU memory
   - Corrupted model files
